Method Overloading:
Method overloading is a technique in which a class can have two or more methods with the same name, but different parameters. The parameters can be different in terms of their number, data type, or order. The compiler determines which method to call based on the arguments passed to it.

For example, consider a class called Math, which has two methods called add(). The first add() method takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum. The second add() method takes three integers as parameters and returns their sum. In this case, we have overloaded the add() method.

public class Math {
public int add(int a, int b) {
return a + b;
}
public int add(int a, int b, int c) {
return a + b + c;
}
}

Method Overriding:
Method overriding is a technique in which a subclass provides its implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method signature (name, return type, and parameters) must be the same in both the superclass and the subclass.

For example, consider a class called Shape, which has a method called calculateArea(). The Shape class is inherited by two subclasses called Circle and Rectangle. Both subclasses override the calculateArea() method to provide their own implementation.

public class Shape {
public double calculateArea() {
//default implementation
return 0;
}
}

public class Circle extends Shape {
private double radius;
public double calculateArea() {
return Math.PI * radius * radius;
}
}

public class Rectangle extends Shape {
private double length;
private double width;
public double calculateArea() {
return length * width;
}
}

Importance of Method Overloading and Method Overriding in OOP:
Method overloading and method overriding are important concepts in OOP because they allow us to create flexible and reusable code. Here are some of their benefits:

Method overloading allows us to create methods with the same name but different parameters, making our code more readable and easier to understand.

Method overriding allows us to provide different implementations of a method in different subclasses, which is useful in cases where we need to perform the same task differently in different contexts.

Method overloading and method overriding promote code reuse and reduce the amount of code we need to write, making our programs more efficient.
